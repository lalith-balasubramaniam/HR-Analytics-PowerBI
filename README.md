![Atlas Labs Overview](Overview.png)

## Project Overview
This project, part of DataCamp's learning series, analyzes HR data for a fictitious software company named **Atlas Labs**. The analysis provides insights into various HR metrics, such as attrition rate, hiring trends, and departmental distributions. This Power BI report is designed to help the companyâ€™s HR department make data-driven decisions by visualizing key performance indicators and employee demographics.

## Project Files
- **HRDataAnalytics.pbix**: The Power BI file containing all data, visualizations, and analysis.
- **Overview.png**: A screenshot of the Power BI report's home page, showing an overview of the dashboard and its main metrics.
- **README.md**: Documentation describing the project, methodology, and insights.

## Data and Analysis
The HR Analytics report includes the following sections:

1. **Overview**: Key metrics such as total employees, active and inactive employees, and attrition rate. Employee hiring trends and attrition data are also visualized by year and department.

2. **Demographics**: Analysis of employee demographics, such as age, gender, and tenure, allowing a better understanding of workforce composition.

3. **Performance Tracker**: Tracks employee performance metrics, highlighting departments or roles that excel or underperform in terms of KPIs.

4. **Attrition**: Insights into employee attrition, with visualizations on factors influencing turnover and comparison across departments and job roles.

## Key Visualizations and Insights
- **Employee Hiring Trends**: A bar chart visualizing the hiring trends over the years, segmented by attrition status.
- **Attrition Rate by Department**: Shows active employees by department and job role, providing insights into departmental distributions and attrition trends.
- **Employee Distribution by Job Role**: A treemap representation of active employees segmented by department and job roles, highlighting concentrations in roles like Software Engineering and Sales.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization, DAX calculations, and building interactive dashboards.
- **DAX Functions**: Applied to calculate metrics such as attrition rates and track key performance indicators.

## How to Use the Project
1. Download **HRDataAnalytics.pbix** from this repository.
2. Open the file in **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Explore the visualizations across the tabs (Overview, Demographics, Performance Tracker, Attrition) to understand the HR insights for Atlas Labs.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped solidify my skills in Power BI, data analysis, and DAX. It also provided experience in creating interactive dashboards that can support decision-making in an HR context.
